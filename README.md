## Some quick design decision explanations

I also play magic, and I'm aware that blue and red are game colors, but I couldn't think of any better background colors for players one and two.

Also, the numbers are inverted for "Player 1" so that the app can be used with players sitting accross the table from each other and will have the life points and button labels be legiable for the player who they belonged to, like other life counter apps I found on the app store.
